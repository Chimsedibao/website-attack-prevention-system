# Brute Force Attack Analysis Report
## Current System Implementation Overview

### Authentication Flow
- The system uses Spring Security with JWT-based authentication
- Login endpoint: `/api/public/auth/login`
- BCrypt password encoding is implemented
- JWT tokens are generated upon successful authentication

### Current Security Measures
1. Password Hashing
   - BCryptPasswordEncoder is used for password hashing
   - Secure password storage implementation

2. Account States
   - Multiple account states are tracked (CHUA_XAC_THUC, DA_XAC_THUC, KHOA_TAI_KHOAN)
   - Email verification required for new accounts

## Vulnerabilities to Brute Force Attacks

### Identified Vulnerabilities

1. No Rate Limiting
   - The current implementation lacks rate limiting on login attempts
   - No delay between consecutive login attempts
   - No tracking of failed login attempts

2. Error Messages
   - Detailed error messages reveal whether an email exists
   - Password failure messages are explicit
   - Debug logging of password matching process (Line 87-89 in UserService)

3. No IP-based Protection
   - No mechanism to detect or block suspicious IP addresses
   - Multiple attempts from the same IP are not monitored

### Risk Assessment

The current implementation is vulnerable to several types of brute force attacks:
- Dictionary attacks on user passwords
- Credential stuffing attacks using known email/password combinations
- Distributed brute force attacks from multiple IPs

## Prevention Methods

### Application-Level Security Improvements

1. Implement Rate Limiting
```java
- Add request rate limiting to the login endpoint
- Implement exponential backoff for failed attempts
- Track failed attempts per user/IP
```

2. Enhance Error Messages
```java
- Use generic error messages (e.g., "Invalid credentials")
- Remove detailed error differentiation
- Remove debug password matching logs
```

3. Account Protection
```java
- Implement temporary account lockout after X failed attempts
- Add CAPTCHA/reCAPTCHA for repeated failed attempts
- Implement multi-factor authentication
```

### Nginx Configuration (WSL2)

1. Rate Limiting Configuration
```nginx
http {
    limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=login_limit:10m rate=5r/m;
    
    server {
        location /api/public/auth/login {
            limit_req zone=login_limit burst=5 nodelay;
            proxy_pass http://backend;
        }
    }
}
```

2. IP-based Protection
```nginx
http {
    # Block IPs with too many failed attempts
    geo $limit {
        default 1;
        # Whitelist internal networks
        10.0.0.0/8 0;
        192.168.0.0/16 0;
    }
}
```

3. Additional Security Headers
```nginx
server {
    # Security headers
    add_header X-Frame-Options "DENY";
    add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff";
    add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block";
}
```

### Additional Recommendations

1. Infrastructure Level
   - Implement Web Application Firewall (WAF)
   - Use DDoS protection services
   - Monitor and log suspicious activities

2. Authentication Enhancements
   - Implement OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect
   - Add support for hardware security keys
   - Enforce strong password policies

3. Monitoring and Alerting
   - Set up real-time monitoring for login attempts
   - Create alerts for suspicious patterns
   - Maintain detailed security logs

## Conclusion

The current system implementation requires additional security measures to protect against brute force attacks. While the basic security framework is in place with Spring Security and JWT, the lack of rate limiting and IP-based protection makes it vulnerable to automated attacks. 

Implementation of the suggested Nginx configurations and application-level security improvements would significantly enhance the system's resistance to brute force attacks. Regular security audits and monitoring should be maintained to ensure the effectiveness of these measures.
